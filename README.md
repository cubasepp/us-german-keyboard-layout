# U.S. German Keyboard Layout

A OS X keyboard layout based on the original U.S. layout with shortcuts for
German umlauts:


| Shortcut | Result |
|     ---: |  :---: |
|       ⌥a |    ä   |
|       ⌥o |    ö   |
|       ⌥u |    ü   |
|      ⌥⇧a |    Ä   |
|      ⌥⇧o |    Ö   |
|      ⌥⇧u |    Ü   |


⌥s results in ß just like in the original U.S. layout.
